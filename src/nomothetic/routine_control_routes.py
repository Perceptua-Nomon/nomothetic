"""Autonomy-routine lifecycle control endpoints (start / stop / stop-all / heartbeat).

These let an operator launch, renew, and stop autonomy routines on the device.
They are the *control* counterpart to the status/log sink in
:mod:`nomothetic.routine_routes`: control here starts and stops the plugin process
via a :class:`~nomothetic.routine_manager.RoutineManager`; that module's endpoints
receive and serve the lifecycle events the running plugin reports.

Launching the plugin is process supervision, not cognition — all autonomy logic
stays in the launched ``autonomon`` process (ADR-004). A routine runs under a
*renewable lease*: the operator sends heartbeats to keep it alive, and it is
auto-stopped if they stop arriving (contact lost) — so a routine continues while
the user maintains contact but cannot run forever once they don't.

This router shares the ``/api/routines`` prefix and inherits the device router's
auth. Endpoints:

* ``GET  /api/routines/available`` — list the routines this device can launch.
* ``POST /api/routines/start``     — launch a routine from a JSON payload.
* ``POST /api/routines/heartbeat`` — renew a running routine's lease (keep-alive).
* ``POST /api/routines/stop``      — stop one running routine.
* ``POST /api/routines/stop-all``  — stop every running routine.
