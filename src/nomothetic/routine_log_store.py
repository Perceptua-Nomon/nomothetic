"""In-memory store for autonomy-routine status and lifecycle logs.

Part of the routine status/log feature (push model). The *brain* (autonomon)
reports its own lifecycle events — ``starting`` / ``running`` / ``stopping`` /
``error`` plus free-form ``log`` lines — to nomothetic, which stores them here
and serves them back via :mod:`nomothetic.routine_routes`.

This is **operational telemetry, not interpretation** (autonomon ADR-004):
nomothetic stores and returns exactly what the brain reports and derives a
coarse status from the event type. It performs no perception, fusion, or
modelling of its own.

The store is in-memory and bounded (a ring buffer per routine) — appropriate
for a Pi Zero 2W and for the device-local, single-run view the API exposes.
Events are segmented by ``run_id``: when a new run reports in, the previous
run's events are cleared so a query returns the *current* run's logs.
